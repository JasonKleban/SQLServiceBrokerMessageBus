# SQL Service Broker Message Bus

A mechanism for a robust service bus implemented natively on SQL Server 2008+ and SQL Service Broker.

Supports Windows Azure-style messaging with both Channels (Azure's "queues") and Topics/Subscriptions broadcasted messages for both permanent and ad hoc subscribers.

The .NET Windows Forms application assist in Message Bus installation and custom configuration script generation.  Once installed and configured, your custom message bus configuration runs entirely on SQL Server.

Easily interacted with over ADO including ADO.NET for sending/receiving on Channels or announcing/subscribing/listening on Topics.
